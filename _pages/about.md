From cosmological simulations to large-scale imaging programmes, from visible wavelengths to radio, the overarching goal of my research is to synthesize interdisciplinary data to understand how galaxies evolve over time. Specifically, my research focuses on the role of galaxy-galaxy mergers on rapid evolution from star-forming spirals like our own Milky Way to quiescent ellipticals. I conduct my research at the University of Victoria as a graduate student working with Dr. Sara Ellison.

Here are some of the things I've worked (or am currently working) on:

Molecular Gas Content with ALMA
======
------

I am currenlty working on developing a legacy dataset that combines optical data products from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and molecular gas measurements from the ALMA archive. 

As a teaser for what is coming, please enjoy this figure of an SDSS galaxy as viewed at the 115 GHz (rest-frame) CO(1-0) emmission line.

Cosmological Simulations
======
------

I generally interface with the cosmological simulation [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/) for the purpose of generating synthetic images of galaxies with realistic properties and environments. 

Below is an example of one IllustrisTNG100-1 post-merger galaxy simulated at 36 different image qualities from my most recent [paper](https://sj-wilkinson.github.io/publication/2024-01-24-TNG-Mergers). The data used to generate this image is publicly available and can be found [here](https://www.canfar.net/storage/vault/list/AstroDataCitationDOI/CISTI.CANFAR/23.0031/data/).

Quantitative Galaxy Morphologies
======
------

Write something about this work here. Include a pretty picture.

Link to data.

Recently and Rapidly Quenched Post-starburst Galaxies
======
------

Write about my work with post-starburst galaxies.

Link to both Sara's paper and mine. 

Large-scale Optical Imaging Programmes
======
------

I am an active member of the [UNIONS](https://unions.skysurvey.cc/) collaboration.

Here is a comparison of a UNIONS and an SDSS image of the same post-starburst galaxy, with relevant non-parametric morphology statistics for post-merger identification labelled.

From cosmological simulations to large-scale imaging programmes, from visible wavelengths to radio, the overarching goal of my research is to synthesize interdisciplinary data to understand how galaxies evolve over time. Specifically, my research focuses on the role of galaxy-galaxy mergers on rapid evolution from star-forming spirals like our own Milky Way to quiescent ellipticals. I conduct my research at the University of Victoria as a graduate student working with Dr. Sara Ellison.

Here are some of the things I've worked (or am currently working) on:

Molecular Gas Content with ALMA
======

I am currenlty working on developing a legacy dataset that combines optical data products from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and molecular gas measurements from the ALMA archive. 

As a teaser for what is coming, please enjoy this figure of an SDSS galaxy as viewed at the (rest-frame) 115 GHz CO(1-0) emmission line. 



Cosmological Simulations
======

I generally interface with the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG for the purpose of extracting synthetic images of galaxies with realistic properties and environments. 

Here's an example of one IllustrisTNG100-1 galaxy simulated at 36 different image qualities.

Quantitative Galaxy Morphologies
======

Write something about this work here. Include a pretty picture.

Recently and Rapidly Quenched Post-starburst Galaxies
======

Write about my work with post-starburst galaxies.

Large-scale Optical Imaging Programmes

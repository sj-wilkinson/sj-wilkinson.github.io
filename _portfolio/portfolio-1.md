In this video, I describe my recent publication '[The limitations (and potential) of non-parametric morphology statistics for post-merger identification](https://sj-wilkinson.github.io/publication/2024-01-24-TNG-Mergers)' for non-astronomers.

The video was made with my Grandma, family, and friends in mind. I learned a lot about video making and science communication and gained a new appreciation for the Youtube content I passively consume. There are some spectacular educators out there.

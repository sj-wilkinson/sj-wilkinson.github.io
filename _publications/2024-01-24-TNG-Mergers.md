title: "The limitations (and potential) of non-parametric morphology statistics for post-merger identification"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-01-24-TNG-Mergers
excerpt: 'Non-parametric morphology statistics have been used for decades to classify
galaxies into morphological types and identify mergers in an automated way. In
this work, we assess how reliably we can identify galaxy post-mergers with
non-parametric morphology statistics. Low-redshift (z<0.2), recent
(t_post-merger < 200 Myr), and isolated (r > 100 kpc) post-merger galaxies are
drawn from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation. Synthetic r-band
images of the mergers are generated with SKIRT9 and degraded to various image
qualities, adding observational effects such as sky noise and atmospheric
blurring. We find that even in perfect quality imaging, the individual
non-parametric morphology statistics fail to recover more than 55% of the
post-mergers, and that this number decreases precipitously with worsening image
qualities. The realistic distributions of galaxy properties in IllustrisTNG
allow us to show that merger samples assembled using individual morphology
statistics are biased towards low mass, high gas fraction, and high mass ratio.
However, combining all of the morphology statistics together using either a
linear discriminant analysis or random forest algorithm increases the
completeness and purity of the identified merger samples and mitigates bias
with various galaxy properties. For example, we show that in imaging similar to
that of the 10-year depth of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a
random forest can identify 89% of mergers with a false positive rate of 17%.
Finally, we conduct a detailed study of the effect of viewing angle on merger
observability and find that there may be an upper limit to merger recovery due
to the orientation of merger features with respect to the observer.'

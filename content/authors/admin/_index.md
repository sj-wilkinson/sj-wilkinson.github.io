**About me**

From cosmological simulations to large-scale imaging programmes, from visible wavelengths to radio, the overarching goal of my research is to synthesize interdisciplinary data to understand how galaxies evolve over time. Specifically, my research focuses on the role of galaxy-galaxy mergers on rapid evolution from star-forming spirals like our own Milky Way to quiescent ellipticals. I conduct my research at the University of Victoria as a graduate student working with Dr. Sara Ellison. 

**Open source and open data**

All code developed as part of my research is open source and available on public repositories, see for instance 
[NMRforMD](https://nmrformd.readthedocs.io), a Python script for calculating hydrogen NMR relaxation rates from molecular dynamics simulations,
or my [Github]repository containing molecular simulation scripts and data.
In parallel, I have been involved in the development of [MAICoS](https://maicos-devel.gitlab.io/maicos/index.html),
a Python toolkit for analyzing confined molecular simulations.

**Outreach**

In parallel to my research activities, I am developing several outreach projects. The most advanced 
among my current projects are the [LAMMPS tutorials]. 
I also wrote [GROMACS tutorials], and manage a
[gallery of animations], along with creating 
[molecular art].
